created dictionary.txt by merge sorting all the other partial dictionaries, adding "I" and "a" to the list.
Then removing all apostrophe chars and making everything lower, and removing duplicates.
I also went in and removed a bunch of two and three letter words that I felt made matching more of a pain.
